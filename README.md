# mdwiki
A tool to help patients ask the right questions for medical support

# DISCLAIMER
We are not doctors, and this project or its contents is not medical advice. It is a tool to help people with certain symptoms or diagnostic test results ask the right questions to qualified medical experts

# Ideas
Create markdown extensions for [marked](https://marked.js.org/using_pro#extensions) to support the expression of medical diagnostic algorithms.
For example:
- Qualification questions ( e.g. has the patient received an organ transplant, if so the associated medications would throw off any lab test results )
- Lab test input ( render an appropriate HTML input element with min/max settings for a given lab result, e.g. blood cell count, % of whatever, etc. )
